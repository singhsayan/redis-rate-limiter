# Redis Rate Limiter (Node.js + Redis + Docker)

A lightweight rate-limiting service built with Node.js and Redis, containerized using Docker. This middleware ensures API endpoints are protected from abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single client within a defined time window.

---

## Tech Stack

- Node.js (Express)
- Redis (In-memory data store)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- ES6 Modules

---

## Features

- Rate limiting logic using Redis with expiry
- Custom middleware using Express
- Handles HTTP 429 Too Many Requests error gracefully
- Dockerized setup with Redis service
- Easy to scale and plug into any Express app

---

## How It Works

- Each incoming request is tracked using the IP address.
- A Redis key is created for the IP with a TTL (time to live).
- If request count exceeds the limit (e.g. 5 requests per 10 seconds), a 429 response is returned.
